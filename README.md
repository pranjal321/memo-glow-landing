## What technologies are used for this project?

This project is built with:

- Vite
- TypeScript
- React
- shadcn-ui
- Tailwind CSS
- Next.js
- supabase
- vercel

## How can I deploy this project?
âœ… Deployment Steps
1. Finalize Your Project Locally
Make sure your project has:
A fully responsive, animated one-page layout using Next.js and Tailwind CSS
Optional backend features: contact form (via Express or Supabase), waitlist, testimonials, etc.
Fully working on desktop and mobile
2. Prepare for Deployment
Ensure youâ€™ve committed all code to a GitHub repo
If using environment variables (e.g., Supabase keys), store them in .env.local
3. Deploy on Vercel
Vercel is the recommended platform for deploying Next.js apps.
Steps:
Go to https://vercel.com
Sign in with GitHub and import your project
Set environment variables if needed (Settings > Environment Variables)
Hit Deploy
Done ðŸŽ‰ Your site will be live on a *.vercel.app domain.

ðŸš€ Bonus: Backend Deployment (if using Express)
If you choose Node.js Express instead of Supabase for backend:
You canâ€™t deploy Express on Vercel directly (Vercel is frontend-focused)
Instead, use:
Render
Railway
Fly.io
Or host it on Supabase Edge Functions (if using Supabase)
If you go the full-stack route:
Deploy frontend on Vercel
Deploy backend on Render/Railway
Make sure CORS and API routes are configured properly

âœ… Post-Deployment Checklist
 Live link is working on desktop and mobile
 Animations and responsiveness verified
 Forms tested (and data stored correctly if backend is used)
 Dark mode toggle (if implemented)
 GitHub repo is clean and public
